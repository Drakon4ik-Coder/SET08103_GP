## Introduction

Population management is crucial for various sectors including urban planning, healthcare, and resource allocation. This application facilitates the management of population data by providing features such as adding population records, updating existing records, and generating statistical reports.

## Features

- **Add Population Records**: Users can add new population records including demographic information.
- **Update Records**: Existing population records can be updated with the latest data.
- **Statistical Reports**: Generate statistical reports based on population data for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize population trends through graphical representations.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language for developing the application logic.
- **Docker**: Utilized for containerization, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **GitHub**: Version control system for collaborative development and code management.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Drakon4ik-Coder/SET08103_GP.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd SET08103_GP
```

3. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t SET08103_GP .
```

4. Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 SET08103_GP
```

5. Access the application through [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your web browser.

## Usage

Once the application is set up, users can perform the following actions:

1. Add new population records by providing necessary demographic information.
2. Update existing records with the latest data.
3. Generate statistical reports to analyze population trends.
4. Visualize population data through graphical representations.
